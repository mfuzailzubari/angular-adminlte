# Angular Setup

## Step 1: Install NPM (Node Package Manager)
First  of all, we are going to need Node js. NPM (node package manager, is a part of node js) is a tool for installing 3rd party libraries and dependencies to our project. If you donâ€™t have it yet, you can download and install it from here. I have also explained it step by step on the tutorial video.

## Step 2: Install Angular CLI
If you have node js installed, the next step is installing the Angular CLI itself to your computer:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Step 3: Create a new Angular Project
After the installation is completed, you can use Angular CLI to create a new Angular project with the following command:
```
ng new my-first-app
```

## Step 4: Run the App
After installing the CLI and creating a new Angular app, the final step is to start the project. To do that, we need to use the following command:
```
ng serve --open
```
